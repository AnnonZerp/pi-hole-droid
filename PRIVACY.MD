# Pi-hole Droid - Privacy

### Why does Pi-hole Droid request permission to access my camera?
The app could scan the QR Code of your Pi-hole to obtain the token to connect to it. This function is available on the "App settings" page.

### Does Pi-hole Droid collect informations?
The app will **locally** store the IP and the token of your Pi-hole for the only purpose of connecting to it.
